## Project Motivation

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I picked Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to find answer to below questions:

1. Which countries are surveyed the most?
2. What are the most popular programming languages?
3. In each country, which programming language is most popular?
4. How are job satisfaction ratings in each country?
5. What are the popular programming languages in Vietnam?
6. What is the level of job satisfaction in Vietnam, Denmark, and Israel based on employment status?
